Project Description
This project is a clone of AirBnB - a simple, command-line based application that allows users to manage properties and bookings.

Command Interpreter Description
The command interpreter, or console, is the main part of our AirBnB clone. It’s a command line interface that allows us to manage the objects of our project.

How to start it
You can start the console by running this command in your terminal:

./console.py

How to use it
Once you’ve started the console, you can use the following commands:

help: Lists all available commands.
quit or EOF: Exits the console.
For example, to get help, you would type:

(hbnb) help
